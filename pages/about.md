## Introduction

The overarching goal of this consortium is to facilitate discussion about how language models can assist experts, in the most useful and responsible manner. We believe we are well-situated at Penn to establish a multidisciplinary forum discussing the usage of language models. These models are actively being used in various fields and we believe such discussions are both timely and critical. We would therefore like to bring together stakeholders of these technologies to facilitate discussion and collaboration.

We plan to conduct workshops, tutorials and panel discussions on various topics. Here are some relevant topics of discussion:

* Expert needs analysis: Discussion about how language (and broadly AI) models can support experts in various fields â€“ this can include established tasks performed by experts as well as novel use cases where AI systems could be useful.
* Ethical implications: Ethical discussions surrounding the use of AI models. This could include bias, misinformation, and moral issues.
* Societal implications: Impact of AI on the workforce and the future of work.
* Accessibility: Ensuring that language models are equally accessible to all users.
* Privacy concerns: Issues concerning user privacy and handling of sensitive information.
* Legal and policy considerations: Legal concerns related to deployment of language models, such as copyrights, content generation rights etc.
* Future Directions: Potential interdisciplinary directions that are worthy of exploration.
